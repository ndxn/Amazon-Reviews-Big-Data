The analysis of the Amazon reviews for the category of outdoor products was accomplished by focusing primarily on the subsets of those reviews submitted into the Vine program, which involves compensation to reviewers and, thus, may potentially affect the review, and non-Vine reviews.
## Population Size
Perhaps the most noticeable difference in the reviews is the sheer disparity in population sizes. The total number of reviews in this dataset is 2,302,401. There are, however, only 3137 reviews that are part of the Vine program and 2,299,255 reviews that were outside the Vine program.
## Review Metrics
The bulk of this analyis is to see if there is bias across reviews when considering whether the reviews were submitted as part of Vine.
Vine reviews averaged 4.37 stars, whereas non-Vine reviews averages at 4.24 stars. For Vine reviewers, 5-star reviews account for 53.75% of total reviews, whereas with non-Vine reviews, 5-star reviews account for 62.33%. These findings are interesting. It seems that non-Vine reviewers are more likely to give 5-star reviews as well and low reviews. This could imply that there is at least a perceived impetus amongst Vine members to balance out their reviews over the top star ratings in order to be perceived as not being biased. It could be that Vine reviewers are also more adept at deciding how products should be rated.
## Review Performance
On average, Vine reviews received 3.06 helpful votes out of an average of 3.92 votes cast, which calculates to 78.06% of readers finding the reviews helpful. These stats are higher than non-Vine reviews, which receive, on average, 1.85 helpful votes out of an average 2.293 votes cast, calculating to 81.12% of voters finding the reviews helpful.
Vine reviews appear to perform better in terms of overall engagement with the review readers. The reason for this trend could be that Amazon prioritizes Vine reviews when shoppers are looking at items. However, in the category, it seems that non-Vine reviews are perceived as more helpful. On explanation for this could be that a review that does not receive compensation my come across as more genuine. 
## Review quantity
Finally, it appears that Vine reviewers are more actively review Outdoor Products. This metric was calculated by grouping the data by customer number and Vine status (as it may be possible that customers have submitted reviews independently and as part of the Vine program). Customers with Vine status have submitted an average of 1.77 reviews in the Outdoor Products category whereas those customers without Vine status have submitted an average of only 1.52 reviews in the same category.
This pretty decisively indicates that compensatoin for Vine reviews has an impact on the likelihood of an Amazon shopper to submit a review.
